# Today, we'll talk about cleaning our data once we have read it into R. For 
# this, we will first discuss storing data in tibbles vs. data frames, as well
# as a new class of data which can be very useful for data analysis, the factor
library("tibble")

# Before we get really into the package functionality today, 

# CRAN page for a package
browseURL("https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tibble/")

# User manual for the package
browseURL("https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tibble/tibble.pdf")

# Vignettes are great for seeing a package "in action"
browseURL("https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tibble/vignettes/tibble.html")

# Make a tibble using vertices and names
A <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
B <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)
C <- c("M", "F", "M", "M", "O", "F", "F", "M", "M", "O")
tibble(number = A, bool = B, sex = C)

# Tibbles will not be created if any column is shorter than another
D <- c("x", "y", "z", "a", "b")
tibble(number = A, bool = B, sex = C, letters = D)

# Factors are really just strings with a defined set of possible values
sexfac <- factor(C)
sexfac <- factor(C, levels = c("F", "M", "O", "Prefer not to say"))
class(sexfac)
levels(sexfac)
tibble(number = A, bool = B, `User sex` = sexfac)

# By default, characters are imported as factors in base R, but a lot of times,
# this isn't what you want, so tidyverse functions by default import all 
# character strings as non-factors, which means you have to explicity change 
# them back to factors...

# You can also coerce regular data frames into tibbles
as_tibble(mtcars)

# Now for data cleaning with R - today we will do a lot of this learning outside
# of R or Rstudio
library("tidyr")

# If you want to learn more about a package, the best place to start is with
# vignettes on the CRAN site
browseURL("https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html")

# But instead, let's actually use Hadley Wickham's online book to learn tidyr :)
browseURL("http://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html")

?table4a
test1 <- as_tibble(cbind(table4a, test = c(1, 2, 3)))
gather(table4a, 2:3, key = "year", value = "cases")

gather(test1, 2:3, key = "year", value = "cases")

View(table2)

spread(table2, key = type, value = count)

table3

separate(table3, `rate`, into = c("cases", "population"), sep = "/")

table5

table5a <- unite(table5, new, 2:3, sep = "")
table5a$new <- as.integer(table5a$new)

### LEARNING FROM TEH INTERWEBZ TODAY ###






# Now, let's practice tidying with the who dataset, a very non-tidy set included
#  with tidyr. To check it out in an interactive editor, use the function View()
View(who)

# And since this dataset is already included with the package, we can find out 
# more about it with the single ? help command
?who

# Now- make who tidy!

who1 <- gather(who, key = "code", value = "value", 5:60)



who1 <- separate(who1, code, c("new", "var", "sexage"))



who1 <- separate(who1, sexage, c("sex", "age"), sep = 1)
who1 <- spread(who1, var, value)
