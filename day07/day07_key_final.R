# We are going to wrap up our tour of dplyr with the summarize and group_by
# functions. The reason I've saved those for today is that they transition 
# really nicely into out other topic of data visualization. These last bits of
# dplyr goodness are at found in the same chapter of R4DS that we used yesterday
# (http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#grouped-summaries-with-summarise)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)

#----------#
# Group by #
#----------#

# Today, we'll just go over the default help page in R for group_by below:

by_cyl <- mtcars %>% group_by(cyl)

# grouping doesn't change how the data looks (apart from listing
# how it's grouped):
glimpse(by_cyl)

# It changes how it acts with the other dplyr verbs:
by_cyl %>% summarise(
  disp = mean(disp),
  hp = mean(hp)
)
by_cyl %>% filter(disp == max(disp))

# Each call to summarise() removes a layer of grouping
by_vs_am <- mtcars %>% group_by(vs, am)
by_vs <- by_vs_am %>% summarise(n = n())
by_vs
by_vs %>% summarise(n = sum(n))

# To removing grouping, use ungroup
by_vs %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  summarise(n = sum(n))

# You can group by expressions: this is just short-hand for
# a mutate/rename followed by a simple group_by
mtcars %>% group_by(vsam = vs + am)

# By default, group_by overrides existing grouping
by_cyl %>%
  group_by(vs, am) %>%
  group_vars()

# Use add = TRUE to instead append
by_cyl %>%
  group_by(vs, am, add = TRUE) %>%
  group_vars()

#-----------------------#
# Summarise / Summarize #
#-----------------------#

# Also just the text of the default help page for summarise/summarize below

# A summary applied to ungrouped tbl returns a single row
mtcars %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(disp), n = n())

# Usually, you'll want to group first
mtcars %>%
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(disp), n = n())

# Each summary call removes one grouping level (since that group
# is now just a single row)
mtcars %>%
  group_by(cyl, vs) %>%
  summarise(cyl_n = n()) %>%
  group_vars()

# Note that with data frames, newly created summaries immediately
# overwrite existing variables
mtcars %>%
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  summarize(sd = sd(disp), disp = mean(disp))

# When it comes to making graphs with the tidyverse, there is no better resource
# than the 'Cookbook for R' by Winston Cheng (there is also a similar cookbook
# made exlusively for graphics, that one is maybe even better). There are many
# great tutorials for using the tidyverse for making ggplot2 (the tidyverse
# plotting package) plots at the corresponding website, located at
# (http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/) - We'll work through some of these 
# examples in class today

# Of course, as ggplot2 is a part of the tidyverse, R4DS contains a lot of spot-
